# PHP Technical Test for BusinessComparison

## Introduction

You have been asked to create a simple form that will allow a user to fill in their personal details and then submit the form to a database, or alternatively to a CSV file, and then send a notification email. Please ensure that the form is secure and that the data is validated. 

After the form is submitted, the user should be redirected to a confirmation page that will display a message to the user.

e.g "Hello `{name}`, thank you for submitting your details."

The form should also allow the user to upload a picture, which will be stored in the database.

We should also be able to view a list of all the users that have been added to the database.

## Requirements

- The form should be secure and the data should be validated, including error messages.
- The form should be submitted and stored to a database.
- The form should POST to an API endpoint after being stored in the database (Credentials will be provided).
